<h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Finance, Literary, and Investigations background. Performed a decade's worth of exploratory research into the science of Human Development as well as organizational studies. My strength is my extensive knowledge on how human beings grow and develop capabilities, and how organizations thrive - a cross disciplinary expertise few has achieved. This is accompanied by Finance knowledge obtained through a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, Banking and Finance specialization.
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    Picked up coding to enhance the 'executive branch' of my capabilities. In my previous job, I performed people-facing work on a daily basis, including presentation, mediation, reporting, and persuasion. I believe coding can become a force multipler on my skillset to drive valuable solutions.
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    Currently pursuing a tech career where I may contribute with my tech stacks. My stacks are the MERN Full Stack - Mongo/MySQL, Express, React, NodeJs. Some of these are micro frameworks with logics that can be more easily transferred to an organization's choice of framework, whether it is Angular, Vue, or .Net. Through extracurriculums in my Full Stack Bootcamp, I have also developed intermediate skills in Python and Leaflet Map, and basic skills in React Native for mobile application development (or progressive web development).
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    My self-development aspiration for the next ten years is to continue building my tech development skills, including deep-tech, to craft valuable solutions through conventional tech and AI.

<h2> Executive Summary of Portfolio Projects </h2>
<h4> Writers' base e-commerce shop and marketplace </h4>

<ul>
  <li>
Developed a mobile responsive web application that provides e-commerce capabilities for an admin user to post products as well as for public users to list products for sale. It is basically carousell for writers. Frontend React, backend server, backend admin system, all built in three and a half weeks.
  </li>

<h4> White Label Mobile Application for event listening - 2023 </h4>

<ul>
  <li>
Developed an almost 'plug and play' React Native mobile application for Android (should also work with iOS but not tested) under the skin of a 'scam call blocker'. Users may quickly build a desired event management, app state management, and action store on top of my mobile application, interacting with a Mongo Database in a 'restful' manner to utilize the data intercepted on those events. Potential application includes managing scam calls coming in, authorizing investment trade signals, or investigating into errors highlighted in the production lines and more. All these imply real time productivity and management of important business events on one's mobile phone.
  </li>
<p></p>
  <li>
  Tech Used: React, React Native, Express, Mongoose Schema, MongoDB, Regex, Stack Navigator, FireBase JWT Authentication, React Functional Programming Hooks

  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<h4> Map Application: The Food Critic - 2023 </h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  Mobile responsive Leaflet web-browser application that allows user to geolocate and look at food critics' picks of top hawker foods in the area. Users can use a random engine to pick at random, critics' picks that are based on the users' desired zoom level or geolocation. Application displays understanding on the usage of marker layers and manipulation using javascript. Search engine employs a dual layer API, calling either Foursquare or Leaflet geo Search. All critics entries on the map were ethically web-scrapped (HTML only, with time intervals, and highly targeted on specific data).
</li>

  <li>
  Tech Used: Javascript, Leaflet, Cheerios (web scrape), FS (for File management)

<h4> Python Customer Service System - 2023</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  This is a Command Line Interface .exe program that allows user to add or import customer information, modify it, and save to a file. Users navigate seamless through the program interface using single number choices and simple y/n branch choices. Data validation is employed along with error catching and recursive functional programming to create seamless program navigation that does not break on user mistakes in data entry (user is re-prompted to key in correct information, confirm information, and redirected as needed).
