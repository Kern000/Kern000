<h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Finance, Literary, and Investigations background. Performed a decade's worth of exploratory research into the science of Human Development as well as organizational studies. My strength is my extensive knowledge on how human beings grow and develop capabilities, and how organizations thrive - a cross disciplinary expertise few has achieved. This is accompanied by the knowledge obtained through a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, with a Banking and Finance specialization.

    Picked up coding to enhance the 'executive branch' of my capabilities. In my previous job, I performed people facing work on a daily basis, including presentation, mediation, reporting, and persuasion. I believe coding can become a force multipler on my skillset to drive valuable solutions.

    Currently pursuing a tech career where I may contribute with my tech stacks. My stacks are the MERN Full Stack - Mongo/MySQL, Express, React, NodeJs. Some of these are micro frameworks whose logics can be more easily transferred to an organization's choice of framework, whether it is Angular, Vue, or .Net. Through extracurriculums in my Full Stack Bootcamp, I have also developed intermediate skills in Python and Leaflet Map, and basic skills in React Native for mobile application development.

    My self-development aspiration for the next ten years is to become proficient in creating an improved Artificial Intelligence model, building an AI that is more powerful than the current generation Generative AI.

<h2> Executive Summary of Portfolio Projects </h2>
<h4> White Label Mobile Application for event listening </h4>

<ul>
<li>
Developed an almost 'plug and play' React Native mobile application for Android (should also work with iOS but not tested) under the skin of a 'scam call blocker'. Users may quickly build a desired event managment, app state management, and action store on top of my mobile application, interacting with a Mongo Database in a 'restful' manner to utilize the data intercepted on those events. Potential application includes managing scam calls coming in, authorizing investment trade signals, or investigating into errors highlighted in the production lines and more. All these imply real time productivity and management of important business events on one's mobile phone.

<h4> Map Application: The Food Critic </h4>
<li>
  Built a mobile responsive Leaflet web-browser application that allows user to geolocate and look at food critics' picks of top hawker foods in the area. This application allows users to use a random engine to pick at random, critics' pick on the desired zoom level or geolocation - as such, the application displays understanding on the usage of marker layers and manipulation of markers using javascript. Search engine employs a dual layer API calling on Foursquare and Leaflet's geo Search. All critics entries on the map were ethically web-scrapped (HTML only, with time intervals, and highly targeted on specific data).
