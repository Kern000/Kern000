<h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Finance, Literary, and Investigations background. Performed a decade's worth of exploratory research into the science of Human Development as well as organizational studies. My strength is my extensive knowledge on how human beings grow and develop capabilities, and how life institutions thrive. This is accompanied by Finance knowledge obtained through a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, Banking and Finance specialization.
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    Picked up coding to enable the creation of valuable tech solutions. In my previous job, I performed people-facing work on a daily basis, including presentation, mediation, reporting, and persuasion. I believe coding can become a force multipler on my skillset to drive valuable solutions.
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    Currently pursuing a tech career where I may contribute with my tech stacks. My stacks are the MERN Full Stack - Mongo/MySQL, Express, React, NodeJs. Some of these are micro frameworks with logics that can be transferrable to an organization's choice of framework, like Angular, Vue, or .Net. And through extracurriculums in my Full Stack Bootcamp, I have also developed intermediate skills in Python and Leaflet Map, and basic skills in React Native for mobile application development (or progressive web development).
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    My self-development aspiration for the next ten years is to continue building my tech development skills, including in deep-tech, to craft valuable solutions through Full Stack frameworks and possibly AI.
  </li>

    <li>
    In terms of OOP (React js), I am a big believer in SOLID principles. The resulting clean and scalable codes are very appealing. When classes take on a single responsibility, and the application of those classes extends but do not modify those codes, and subordinate classes are logical offsprings, code becomes that much more descriptive and consistent.

<h2> Executive Summary of Portfolio Projects </h2>
<h4> Writers' base e-commerce shop and marketplace </h4>

<ul>
  <li>
Developed a mobile responsive web application that provides e-commerce capabilities for an admin user to post products, as well as for public users to list products for sale. It is basically the carousell / pivix app for writers. The frontend React, backend server, and backend admin system were all built in three and a half weeks.
  </li>
<p></p>
  <li>
  Tech Used: React functional programming hooks, React-dotenv, Stripe React, axios, Express, Db-migrate, bookshelf model with knex methods, MySQL/Postgres, Cloudinary Image upload and sanitization, Caolan forms, handlebars server-side templating engine, sessions, csurf, JWT Authentication, regex validation.
  </li>

  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/Kern000/proj3-frontend"> Frontend repo (site UI/UX navigation screenshots for faster viewing) </a>
  </li>
  <li>
  <a href="https://github.com/Kern000/project-three-backend"> Backend repo (showcases MySQL/Postgres Model and backend templating engine) </a>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4> White Label Mobile Application for event listening - 2023 </h4>

<ul>
  <li>
Developed an almost 'plug and play' React Native mobile application for Android (may work with iOS but not tested and packaged for it) under the skin of a 'scam call blocker'. Users may quickly build a desired event management, app state management, and action store on top of my mobile application, interacting with a Mongo Database in a 'restful' manner to utilize the data intercepted on those events. Potential application includes managing incoming scam calls, authorizing investment trade signals, or investigating into errors highlighted in the production lines and more - possible productivity on a mobile phone. 
  </li>
<p></p>
<li>
Backend was also an interesting experiment on the 'factory' method in creating restful endpoints. This method allows unchanging codes in server even when database expands in scope due to expanding business needs.
  </li>
<p></p>
  <li>
  Tech Used: React, React Native, Express, Mongoose schema, Mongo aggregation pipeline, MongoDB, Regex, Stack Navigator, FireBase JWT Authentication, React Functional Programming Hooks, JOI middleware validation
  </li>

<h4> Map Application: The Food Critic - 2023 </h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  This is a mobile responsive Leaflet web-browser application that allows user to geolocate and look at food critics' picks of top hawker foods in the area. Users can use a random engine to pick at random, critics' picks that are based on the users' desired zoom level or geolocation. Application displays understanding on the usage of marker layers and manipulation using javascript. Search engine employs a dual layer API, calling either Foursquare or Leaflet geo Search. All critics entries on the map were ethically web-scrapped (HTML only, with time intervals, and highly targeted on specific data). This application pursues utmost simplicity in UI/UX for a comfortable viewing experience, while providing readily available tools that scale to different users' needs.

<h4> Python Customer Service System - 2023</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
  This is a Command Line Interface .exe program that allows user to add or import customer information, modify it, and save to a file. Users navigate seamless through the program interface using single number choices and simple y/n branch choices. Data validation is employed along with error catching and recursive functional programming to create seamless program navigation that does not break on user mistakes in data entry (user is re-prompted to key in correct information, confirm information, and redirected as needed).  
</li>
<p></p>
  <li>
  Tech Used: PyTest, PyInstaller, Python, Regex, JSON package
